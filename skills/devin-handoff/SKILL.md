# Devin Handoff

Hand off a task to Devin. Devin gets its own VM with shell, browser,
and full repo access. You get a URL to watch progress, or can poll
until the session completes.

## Interface

**Inputs**: task and optional context, or an existing Devin session ID
**Outputs**: Devin session URL, status updates, and PR URL when available
**Side effects**: creates or archives remote Devin sessions; remote sessions may create branches and PRs

Under pi, invoke the script through the global skill path shown below so commands
work from any repository. If another harness installs the skill elsewhere, resolve
the same script relative to this `SKILL.md`.

## Prerequisites

- `DEVIN_API_KEY` env var (get one at https://app.devin.ai/settings/api-keys)
- `curl`, `jq` in PATH
- `git` (optional, for auto-detecting repo/branch/diff)

## When to use

- Task needs a running server, database, or Docker
- Task requires browser interaction (OAuth, screenshots, E2E tests)
- Task involves CI/CD pipelines or deployments
- Task is long-running and the user wants to continue locally
- You need parallel execution on a separate machine

## Steps

### 1. Gather context

From the current working directory:

1. **Repo**: Run `git remote get-url origin`, extract `owner/repo`
2. **Branch**: Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
3. **Diff**: Run `git diff HEAD` (truncated to 100KB automatically)
4. **Task**: The user's request, concise and specific
5. **Context** (optional): Summarize what you've learned — files examined,
   root cause hypotheses, partial fixes

### 2. Create the session

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/devin-handoff/scripts/devin-handoff.sh create \
  --task "Fix the auth timeout bug — update middleware to respect configured timeout" \
  --context "Investigated src/auth/session.py and src/auth/middleware.py. Timeout is hardcoded at 30m in session.py:42."
```

The script auto-detects repo, branch, and diff. The `--context` flag is
optional but helps Devin start faster. All sessions are automatically
tagged with `handoff`.

### 3. Report the URL and poll

Tell the user the session URL. If they want to wait for completion,
poll until the session finishes:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/devin-handoff/scripts/devin-handoff.sh poll SESSION_ID --interval 15
```

The poll command prints status updates and exits when Devin finishes.
It also prints the PR URL if one was created.

### 4. Archive when done (optional)

Archive a session to clean it up from the sidebar:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/devin-handoff/scripts/devin-handoff.sh archive SESSION_ID --org-id ORG_ID
```

Or use `--archive` on `poll` to auto-archive when the session finishes:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/devin-handoff/scripts/devin-handoff.sh poll SESSION_ID --interval 15 --archive --org-id ORG_ID
```
